# Chapter 10 Homework

This homework will give you practice at working with a measurement dataset: `airlift_mass_repeatability.csv`. This data set represents repeated measures of "blank" air sampling filters. 

A couple notes to consider when reporting answers in response to questions. The microbalance used to make these measurements reads out to the nearest microgram ($\mu g$), which is 0.000001 $g$ or 0.001 $mg$. Thus, be careful when reporting descriptive statistics so as not to overstate your **precision**. Use the `round()` function to avoid reporting more than 0.1 $\mu g$ of precision (or 0.0001 $mg$). Here is some example code that uses the `across()` function from `dplyr::` to round numeric output to just four digits (appropriate for $mg$ units in this exercise):

`dplyr::mutate(across(.cols = where(is.numeric), .fns = round, 3))`

\newpage

## Question 1
Import the `airlift_mass_repeatability.csv` file into a data frame called `blanks` and perform the following data wrangling in a single pipe:  

- retain only the first 3 columns of data;
- rename the columns with the names `date`, `id`, and `mass_mg`;
- convert the `date` column vector into a date class object using `lubridate::`
- convert the `id` variable to a class `factor` (this can be accomplished using `base::as.factor()` or `purrr::as_factor()`)
- create a new column vector named `mass_mg` by rescaling the `mass_g` data (i.e., convert $g$ to $mg$ by multiplying `mass_g` by 1000)

```{r import-clean-data}
blanks <- read.csv("../data/AIRLIFT_mass_repeatability.csv") %>%
  dplyr::select(1:3) %>%
  rename(date = 1, id = 2, mass_g = 3) %>%
  mutate(date = dmy(date),
         id = as.factor(id),
         mass_mg = mass_g * 1000,
         across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 4)))

head(blanks)

```

## Question 2:  

  2a. Are there any NAs present in the data frame?  
  2b. How many unique filter IDs are present in this data frame?  
  2c. How many samples are present for each filter ID? Hint: look up the `dplyr::count()` function.  
  2d. Over how long of a period were these blank measurements made? Hint: this can be done in base R with a `max() - min()` or with `lubridate::interval() %>% as.duration()`.
```{r unique-IDs}
#check for NAs?
paste0("NAs present: ", sum(is.na(blanks)))

#Unique IDs
paste0("Unique IDs: ", n_distinct(blanks$id))

#Samples filter IDs
blanks %>%
  count(id)

#Time
max(blanks$date) - min(blanks$date)


```

## Question 3

Group the `blanks` data frame by `id` and calculate mean, median, and standard deviations for each filter id.  Hint: use `group_by() %>% summarise()` to do this efficiently.

```{r blank-descriprives}

blanks %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_mass_mg = mean(mass_mg),
    median_mass_mg = median(mass_mg),
    sd_mass_mg = sd(mass_mg)) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 4)))

```

## Question 4

Calculate the limit of detection (LOD) for this measurement method. Note: you will need to calculate standard deviations for each filter `id` (as done in question 3) and then estimate LOD from $LOD = 3\cdot \sigma_b$ where $\sigma_b$ is calculated for each filter `id`.

```{r Limit-of-detection}

blanks %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise(
    sd_mass_mg = sd(mass_mg)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    LOD_mg = 3 * sd_mass_mg
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 4)))

```
